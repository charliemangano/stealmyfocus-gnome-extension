Steal My Focus - Gnome Shell Extension
======================================

Forked from https://github.com/kagesenshi/gnome-shell-extension-stealmyfocus to support my gnome shell version (43.9).

Let windows steal focus. Removes the annoying 'Window is ready'
notification and focus window immediately.
